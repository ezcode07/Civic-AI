# The Problem: Bureaucratic Complexity

## 🛑 The Challenge
Government documents, legal notices, and scheme details are often written in complex, technical language (legalese) that is difficult for the average citizen to understand. This complexity creates a significant barrier to access.

## 📉 Key Pain Points
1.  **Language Barrier**: Many official documents are in English or formal Hindi, which may not be the user's primary language or dialect.
2.  **Information Overload**: Citizens are overwhelmed by dense text and unclear instructions.
3.  **Fear of Non-Compliance**: The fear of misunderstanding a legal notice often leads to anxiety and inaction.
4.  **Lack of Accessibility**: Information is often scattered across multiple websites, making it hard to find a single source of truth.

## 🔍 Impact
- Eligible citizens miss out on welfare schemes.
- Legal notices are ignored or misunderstood, leading to penalties.
- Increased dependency on middlemen and agents, often leading to exploitation.
