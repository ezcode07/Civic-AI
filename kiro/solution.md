# The Solution: AI-Powered Civic Assistance

## 💡 Our Approach
Civic-AI acts as a personal civic assistant, using Generative AI to interpret, simplify, and explain government interactions.

## 🛠 Core Capabilities

### 1. Document Analysis (OCR + AI)

- **Process**: 
    - OCR (Tesseract) extracts the text.
    - LLM (OpenAI/Gemini) analyzes the content.
- **Output**: A simplified summary, key dates, and required actions.

### 2. Interactive Chatbot
- Users can ask follow-up questions about the analyzed document or general queries about schemes.

### 3. Scheme Discovery
- Personalized recommendations for government schemes based on user profile (age, income, location).

## 🌈 Benefits
